# Azurlane
I've refactored the code logic to fix the crashing issue <br>

This translation service is weak and can't express my meaning correctly, so I won't explain how to fix it <br>

# How to use
* Just load my library directly, no need to define additional methods <br><br>
    * open `com\unity3d\player\UnityPlayerActivity.smali` , find `onCreate` method.

    ```
    .method protected onCreate(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V
    .locals 2
    ``` 
    * Insert loading code under .locals 2  <br>

    ```
    const-string v0, "JMBQ"
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V
    ```
    * Then put my library into the correct lib directory of the apk, compile and sign the apk<br><br>
* Actually my library doesn't need context support, if you know which methods will be loaded first after the game starts, you can also load my library in that method with the same effect


# Config
Settings can be found inside `JMBQ.ini`, located within the game's external files directory (`/sdcard/Android/data/{package-name}/files/`).

If you're unsure of your region's package name, just look it up. All of them include "AzurLane" though.

Enabling the Skins mod gives you all skins in-game as if you had bought them. They are persistent between restarts.
